# Custom HTTP/HTTPS Connection and JSON Database Implementation in Python

## Description
This project implements a custom HTTPS connection functionality in Python, along with a JSON database. It provides a secure way to establish communication over HTTPS using the Python programming language. The project includes the generation of custom RSA certificates for learning purposes, rather than relying on certified SSL certificates. It allows you to make requests to HTTPS endpoints, handle custom RSA certificates, and interact with a JSON database to store and retrieve data securely.
